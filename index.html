    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Methods</h2>

      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID Methods</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid introducing requirements in your did method specification that are
        not described in [[DID-CORE]], or registered in the
        [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid constructing a new DID Method that is nearly identical to existing
        DID Methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several "families" of DID Methods, including
        <a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"
          >Hyperledger Indy</a
        >, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and
        various methods that share similar smart contracts or rely on shared
        content addressing technology.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        Implementers are cautioned to write and regularly run integration and
        interoperability tests that span these "families", in order to ensure
        methods have sufficient support for open standards and real
        interoperability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary user facing aspects of a DID Method are its
        <a href="#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a>
        and it's
        <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data Registry</a>.
        Together these determine most of the unique properties of a DID Method,
        and its privacy and security properties compared to other methods.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>DID Syntax</h3>
        <p class="note">
          See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoid allowing users to control the structure of the DID Unique
          Suffix, also referred to as the <code>id-char</code> in the ABNF. This
          can be accomplished by coupling the create operation canonical
          representation to the the <code>id-char</code>. It can also be
          accomplished by leveraging sources of entropy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Avoid vanity DIDs, for example,
          <code>did:example:deadbeef1f236...</code>, the structure of the
          identifier should not be relied on for anything other than collision
          resistance. Be especially careful of trusting a relationship between a
          did subject and did controller without relying on a cryptographically
          secure verification relationship for
          <a href="authentication">authentication</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the nature of the
          <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a>, publishing
          <code>type</code> or <code>kind</code> might be advantageous for
          decentralized discovery or mass surveilance. Implementers are not to
          rely on conformance to specification text while implementing
          decentralized identifiers.

        <h2>Verifiable Data Registry</h2>

        <p class="note">
          See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry"
            >Verifiable Data Registry</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a> is the system to which
          DID Operations such as Create, Resolve, Update and Deactivate are
          applied.
        </p>

        <p>
          Typically a globally unique tamper evident immutable log is used to
          produce a verifiable data registry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Blockchains or distributed ledgers are popular choices for building
          verifiable data registries, but there are other solutions which yield
          unique security pros and cons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some DID methods rely on centralized trusted service providers and
          merkle proofs, to provide tamper evident logs without the costs
          associated with distributeted consensus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some DID methods rely on multiple registries, that may not be globally
          available.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some DID methods might rely on legacy security infrastructure, such as
          TLS or TOR.
        </p>

        <p>
          Few DID methods support portability accross verifiable data
          registries, and altering the VDR associated with a DID will almost
          certainly impact Privacy and Security considerations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Intead of designing complex DID Methods with registry portability,
          consider supporting multiple did methods that have each been designed
          to support disjoint security or privacy consideration, for example:
          globally discoverable, offline, pairwise unique, linked to existing
          roots of trust such as websites, etc...
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the nature of the VDR, it may be desirable to store data
          other than DID Documents, for example: verifiable credentials,
          templates or schemas for credentials, discovery meta data or integrity
          or content addresable identifiers for related information.
