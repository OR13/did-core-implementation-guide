      <h2>Methods</h2>

      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID Methods</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid introducing requirements in your did method specification that are
        not described in [[DID-CORE]], or registered in the
        [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid constructing a new DID Method that is nearly identical to existing
        DID Methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several "families" of DID Methods, including
        <a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"
          >Hyperledger Indy</a
        >, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and
        various methods that share similar smart contracts or rely on shared
        content addressing technology.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        Implementers are cautioned to write and regularly run integration and
        interoperability tests that span these "families", in order to ensure
        methods have sufficient support for open standards and real
        interoperability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary user facing aspects of a DID Method are its
        <a href="#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a>
        and it's
        <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data Registry</a>.
        Together these determine most of the unique properties of a DID Method,
        and its privacy and security properties compared to other methods.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>DID Syntax</h3>
        <p class="note">
          See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoid allowing users to control the structure of the DID Unique
          Suffix, also referred to as the <code>id-char</code> in the ABNF. This
          can be accomplished by coupling the create operation canonical
          representation to the the <code>id-char</code>. It can also be
          accomplished by leveraging sources of entropy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Avoid vanity DIDs, for example,
          <code>did:example:deadbeef1f236...</code>, the structure of the
          identifier should not be relied on for anything other than collision
          resistance. Be especially careful of trusting a relationship between a
          did subject and did controller without relying on a cryptographically
          secure verification relationship for
          <a href="authentication">authentication</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the nature of the
          <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a>, publishing
          <code>type</code> or <code>kind</code> might be advantageous for
          decentralized discovery or mass surveilance. Implementers are not to
          rely on conformance to specification text while implementing
          decentralized identifiers.

        <h2>Verifiable Data Registry</h2>

        <p class="note">
          See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry"
            >Verifiable Data Registry</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a> is the system to which
          DID Operations such as Create, Resolve, Update and Deactivate are
          applied.
        </p>

        <p>
          Typically a globally unique tamper evident immutable log is used to
          produce a verifiable data registry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Blockchains or distributed ledgers are popular choices for building
          verifiable data registries, but there are other solutions which yield
          unique security pros and cons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some DID methods rely on centralized trusted service providers and
          merkle proofs, to provide tamper evident logs without the costs
          associated with distributeted consensus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some DID methods rely on multiple registries, that may not be globally
          available.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some DID methods might rely on legacy security infrastructure, such as
          TLS or TOR.
        </p>

        <p>
          Few DID methods support portability accross verifiable data
          registries, and altering the VDR associated with a DID will almost
          certainly impact Privacy and Security considerations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Intead of designing complex DID Methods with registry portability,
          consider supporting multiple did methods that have each been designed
          to support disjoint security or privacy consideration, for example:
          globally discoverable, offline, pairwise unique, linked to existing
          roots of trust such as websites, etc...
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the nature of the VDR, it may be desirable to store data
          other than DID Documents, for example: verifiable credentials,
          templates or schemas for credentials, discovery meta data or integrity
          or content addresable identifiers for related information.

      <h2>DID Resolution</h2>

      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-resolution"
          >DID Resolution</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        DID resolution is a function which takes a DID, and produces a DID
        Resolution response in a representation, most commonly JSON.
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="Resolution response for did+json">
        {
          "didDocument": {
            "@context": [
              "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
            ],
            "id": "did:example:123",
          },
          "didDocumentMetaData": {
            "content-type": "application/did+json"
          },
          "didResolutionMetaData": {}
        }
      </pre>

      <p>
        DID resolution can be proxied through intermediariees such as command
        line tools or http servers. Because the DID Document contains key
        material, such intermediaries represent excellent targets for attackers,
        becuase these systems can be used to tamper with verification
        relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid tampering with a DID Document that as been returned by did method
        software. It is better to throw an error than attempt problemss in the
        underlying DID Method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid transforming DID Documents without the consent of the did subject
        or controller.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever possible, run all software necessary to support a DID Method
        yourself.

        <h3>Representations</h3>

        <p class="note">
          See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#representations"
            >Representations</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The [[DID-CORE]] specification describes representations and the
          [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] supports the registration of an unbounded
          number of alternative representations.
        </p>

        <p>Each representation has unique pros and cons.</p>

        <p>
          DID Methods are responsible for producing a DID Document in the
          requested representation.
        </p>

        <p>
          DID Method implementers may choose to return verification methods in
          alternate formats for representations, for example, an implementer
          might prefer to return verification material encoded with
          <code>publicKeyJwk</code> for <code>application/did+json</code> and
          <code>publicKeyBase58</code> for <code>application/did+ld+json</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a DID Method supports both <code>application/did+json</code> and
          <code>application/did+ld+json</code> if it recommended that they both
          include an <code>@context</code> and that both be capable of
          supporting linked data proofs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Avoid allowing arbitrary unknown properties into
          <code>application/did+json</code> such as <code>__proto__</code> or
          other characters that might be used to attack JSON parsing.
        </p>

        <p>
          While <code>application/did+json</code> is very flexible, and allows
          for arbitrary JSON, implementers are cautioned to implement security
          in depth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Implementers are cautioned to review
          <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Implementers should confirm that each representation they decide to
          support is interoperable with the same representation in other did
          methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Implementers should avoid guessing about conformance to [[DID-CORE]].

      </p>

      <p>
        Verification relationships are loosely equivalent to the concept of key
        purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is considered a security best practice not to reuse the same key for
        multiple purposes.
